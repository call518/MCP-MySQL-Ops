### üîß Code Contributions

#### Adding New MCP Tools

The codebase is designed to be developer-friendly. To add a new monitoring tool:

1. **Add your function to `src/mcp_mysqlql_ops/mcp_main.py`:**
   ```python
   @mcp.tool()
   def get_your_new_tool(
       parameter1: str = "default_value",
       parameter2: int = 10
   ) -> list[dict]:
       """
       Brief description of what this tool does.
       
       Args:
           parameter1: Description of parameter1
           parameter2: Description of parameter2
           
       Returns:
           List of dictionaries with monitoring data
       """
       # Your implementation here
       pass
   ```

2. **Follow these patterns:**
   - Use descriptive function names starting with `get_`
   - Include comprehensive docstrings
   - Handle MySQL version compatibility
   - Return structured data (list of dictionaries)
   - Use read-only queries only

3. **Test across MySQL versions:**
   - Test with MySQL 12, 15, 16, 17 if possible
   - Ensure graceful degradation for version-specific features
   - Update the Tool Compatibility Matrix in README

#### Code Style Guidelines

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 standards
- **SQL**: Use uppercase for SQL keywords, lowercase for identifiers
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic and MySQL-specific behavior
- **Error handling**: Provide meaningful error messages
- **Version compatibility**: Always consider MySQL version differences

#### Testing Your Changes

1. **Manual testing:**
   ```bash
   # Test with local development
   python -m src.mcp_mysqlql_ops.mcp_main --log-level DEBUG
   
   # Test with MCP Inspector
   ./scripts/run-mcp-inspector-local.sh
   ```

2. **Version compatibility testing:**
   - Test against different MySQL versions
   - Verify tool behavior with and without extensions
   - Check error handling for unsupported features

### üìö Documentation

**Use the [Documentation Issue template](https://github.com/call518/MCP-MySQL-Ops/issues/new?template=documentation.md)** to report documentation problems.

Help improve our documentation by:
- Fixing typos or unclear explanations
- Adding usage examples
- Improving tool descriptions
- Updating compatibility information

## MySQL-Specific Guidelines

### Version Compatibility

- **Support MySQL 12-17**
- Use version detection: `get_mysqlql_version()`
- Handle version-specific features gracefully
- Update compatibility matrix when adding features

### Query Guidelines

- **Read-only operations only** - no data modification
- Use system catalogs and statistics views
- Handle missing extensions gracefully
- Optimize for performance on production systems
- Mask sensitive information in outputs

### Extension Handling

- Most tools should work without extensions
- For `Performance Schema` dependent features, check availability first
- Provide fallback behavior when extensions are missing
- Document extension requirements clearly

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow the coding guidelines
   - Add or update tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Test with multiple MySQL versions
   - Verify backward compatibility
   - Check error handling

4. **Commit with clear messages:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add tool for monitoring connection pooling
   
   - New get_connection_pool_stats function
   - Compatible with MySQL 12-17
   - Handles missing Performance Schema gracefully"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Then create a Pull Request using our [PR template](https://github.com/call518/MCP-MySQL-Ops/compare) which will guide you through the submission process.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Our **Pull Request template** will help you provide:
- **Clear title and description**
